Docker file:
==============
- Contains instructions to build a docker image
- Docker image consists of read only layers. each layer == each instruction

build command:
docker build -f <dockerfile_path>
 
Example of dockerfile:
https://hub.docker.com/_/hello-world
https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/tree/master/amd64/hello-world

Ex: dockerfile for hello-world image
FROM scratch
COPY hello /
CMD ["/hello"]

here FROM, COPY and CMD are the dockerfile instructions

Ex: more advanced Docker file
https://hub.docker.com/layers/grafana/grafana/main-ubuntu/images/sha256-0062b05202abc967c40832142159ea2f8001cb07fe1cc3ee46597002fd7d3d27


More about dockerfile instructions:
https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/

There are rules to be followed for dockerfile:
1. A Dockerfile must begin with a FROM instruction. 
2. # is used to comment a line in docker file( they will be removed during build)
3. Only one CMD or ENTRY_POINT should be present, if multiple of these commands
present, then only last command will be considered

some of the import instructions:
FROM:

	FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image> [AS <name>]
	FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[:<tag>] [AS <name>]
	FROM [--platform=<platform>] <image>[@<digest>] [AS <name>]

	=> should be the first instruction in any docker file
	=> initializes new build stage and sets the base image
	=> Only ARG instruction can be used before FROM

RUN:
	# Shell form:
	RUN [OPTIONS] <command> ...
	# Exec form:
	RUN [OPTIONS] [ "<command>", ... ]
	
	=> Execute any commands to create new layer on top of the current image
	=> Two forms, shell and exec forms.
	=> shell forms  is similar to how we use cli executables options
	Ex: RUN apt-get install -y curl
	=> exec forms is similar to how we pass the arguments to a program
	Ex: RUN ["python", "hello world.py"]
	=> RUN instruction happens during build time

CMD:
	CMD python hello-world.py
	CMD ["python", "hello-world.py"]
	
	=> The CMD instruction sets the command to be executed when running a container from an image.
	=> There can only be one CMD instruction per dockerfile. If more than one, only
	the last command will take effect.
	=> CMD instruction does not execute during build time. only provide the command
	for running the image.
	
ADD
	ADD [OPTIONS] <src> ... <dest>
	ADD [OPTIONS] ["<src>", ... "<dest>"]
	Ex:
	ADD file1.txt file2.txt /destination/folder/
	
	=> allows you to copy files from local to filesystem of the image
	=> you can use wildcard to specify source
	Ex:
	Add folder1/* destination/folder/ = > copies all the folders inside folder1
	to destination/folder/
	=> destination must end with /

COPY
	COPY [OPTIONS] <src> ... <dest>
	COPY [OPTIONS] ["<src>", ... "<dest>"]
	
	=> The COPY instruction copies new files or directories from <src> and adds them to the filesystem of the image at the path <dest>.
	
ENTRYPOINT:
	Exec form:
	ENTRYPOINT ["executable", "param1", "param2"]
	shell form:
	ENTRYPOINT command param1 param2
	
	=> An ENTRYPOINT allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable

WORKDIR:
	WORKDIR /path/to/workdir
	=> sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD

Useful cli commands:

to build a dockerfile
>> docker build -f first.dockerfile -t firstimage .

>> sudo docker images 
# lists the firstimage 

to run a dockerfile
>> docker run firstimage

to override argument in dockerfile
>> docker run thirdimage khan

Lab:
# Install docker in EC2 using commands from below url:
https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

# clone github repo to local
git clone https://github.com/lzmkhan/dockercourse.git

# use change directory to navigate to dockercourse folder
cd dockercourse

# use ls to see what files are present
ls 

# use cat to read content of hello_world.py
cat hello_world.py

# use cat to view first.dockerfile
cat first.dockerfile

# check the content of first.dockerfile

# build your first docker image
docker build -f first.dockerfile -t firstimage .
=> -t means tag
=> -f means filepath of the dockerfile
=> . means local cache

# check if image is created
docker images

# run your first docker container image
docker run firstimage

# check if the firstimage is listed in ps command
docker ps -a

repeat for secondimage, thirdimage and fourthimage
read the dockerfiles for difference and how we are leverage base layers
and extending them.
